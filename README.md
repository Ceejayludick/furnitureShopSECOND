Second attempt at Furniture Shop! 

Project Title: 

A Furniture Store using HTML, CSS and JS. 


Project Description:

The Furniture Store is designed to provide an online platform for users to browse and purchase furniture items. The application allows users to view different categories of furniture, explore individual product details, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process.

The project utilizes HTML for the structure of the web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactive functionalities.

How to Use the Project

- accessing the web store is simple, the link attached ti GitHub will give you access to the store. 
- Once you are on the web store the design is simple and user friendly, so clicking on a heading in the navbar would give you access to the contents attached to each page. 

Adding to cart:

- Simply hovering over any product in the SHOP page would give you the option to add to cart. 
- In cart you simply add your chosen item and it will automatically be taken to your checkout cart. 


Code used and why:

The three Coding languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTMl has been used to format the basic structure of the webpage and accompanying content that will be displayed on the Online Store. CSS was used for styling purposes; mainly with regard to color choices, layout, sizing and fonts and backgrounds used for the app. Lastly, Javascript has been used mainly for interactivity purposes so that users inputs can dynamically input complex actions that HTML and CSS can't.


Challenges faced:

Quite a few challenges came up during the creation of the Shop. These include:

- Struggling to find a correct and aesthetic color scheme and general UI+UX design for the shop. This was overcome by using a color matching tool online, which gave similar and matching colors which were eventually incorporated into the design of the shop.

- Zoom on hover issue: a rather juvenile issue came up wherein the code for being able to hover over look book products wasn't working at all. Upon looking over the code, I found that I had forgotten to target the correct class in CSS. This meant that all code in CSS was void. It was fixed by targeting the right code.

- Image sizing = Images above 300kb were consistently used in the old version of this shop. Every image has been reconfigured to be the correct size required for the marking standards of the assignment.

- Cart functionality = an issue came up wherein I couldn't get the functionality of the cart to work. I.e. the layout and core functions of adding to cart and removing from cart simply didn't work. Upon further debugging and redoing code, it eventually worked out. 


How to use Project:

The project has the general layout of any web store type website. The main headings used are basic parts to the web store, and are: 
1. An About section = wherein details about the company/store are listed, including a Mission and Vision, details about how the company/web store was started and by who, as well as general Corporate information regarding the company.

2. A Shopping Cart section = wherein all the items selected to be 'shopped' will be displayed. Each of these items will also have an accompanying image and price tag banner.

3. A Contact page = Wherein all details of the company is listed, including a Google Maps insert that shows the exact location of the company's physical address whilst also allowing the user to make easy use of Google Maps for direction purposes. Additionally, the company's Linkedin, Gmail, Github, Instagram and YouTube are also linked in the contact page. 

4. A Look book page = showing all the different ranges of products available from the company.

5. A Shop page = wherein the user will be able to make a selection from a range of products on display, which will also give the user the ability to add specific products to the shopping cart for purchase.

6. A Home Page = which acts as the default page for the web store. 


Dependencies:

The Furniture Store web application does not have any external dependencies. It is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
