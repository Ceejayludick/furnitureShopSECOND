Second attempt at Furniture Shop 

Title: A Furniture Store using HTML, CSS and JS. 

Project Description:

The Furniture Store is designed to provide an online platform for users to browse and purchase furniture items. The application allows users to view different categories of furniture, explore individual product details, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process.

The project utilizes HTML for the structure of the web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactive functionalities.

Code used and why:

The three Coding languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTMl has been used to format the basic structure of the webpage and accompanying content that will be displayed on the Online Store. CSS was used for styling purposes; mainly with regard to color choices, layout, sizing and fonts and backgrounds used for the app. Lastly, Javascript has been used mainly for interactivity purposes so that users inputs can dynamically input complex actions that HTML and CSS can't.
